## Reporting security issues

We take security very seriously and develop all projects to be secure and safe.

If you find (or simply suspect) a security issue in any of our projects, please send us an email to complabs28@gmail.com.

Thanks for helping make Tech Fiddle Projects safe for everyone.

**We encourage responsible disclosure for the sake of our users, so please reach out before posting in a public space.**
