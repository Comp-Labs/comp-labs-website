# Introduction

<!-- truncate -->

**macOS 13** also known as **macOS Ventura** as announced on the 6<sup>th</sup> June, 2022 in [WWDC22](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc2022/). It's amazing to see that every year, Apple is introducing new products to the market. And this year, **macOS Ventura** comes with the all-new **M2 Chip** preloaded on the new Macs. Compared to the previous versions of macOS, Apple has brought a lot of changes taking from UI to settings. And by the way, did I tell you that from now onwards, **System Preferences** is named as **System Settings** from now on. New settings that look similar to Ubuntu settings have been added. Cool new features are added such as **Stage Manager**, **Spotlight**, Convert your **iPhone** to Webcams, and more. If you are a Windows user, looking forward to testing the new macOS Ventura, perhaps you should consider this guide.

Since Virtualisation is so powerful, it can give you the macOS feel in real-time while using your Windows Apps. After experiencing the operating system, you can give your opinion about the macOS 13. So why you are waiting, let's start the process of Installing macOS Ventura on Windows using VirtualBox.

## Intel VT-x and AMD-V

Make sure that you enable the virtualisation feature also known as Intel VT-x and AMD-V from the BIOS of your computer otherwise you won't be able to run the Virtual Machine. However, if your computer does not support virtualisation technology, then you can't install macOS Ventura. I am afraid you have to purchase a new computer.

To check if your computer supports and has enabled virtualisation technology, there is a simple method that you can use to check right now. And it is to open `Task Manager` > Go to `Performance` Tab > Select `CPU` and check the **virtualisation status** as shown below.
