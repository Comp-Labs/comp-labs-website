# Enable the New Desktop Stickers in Windows 11 22H2

![Image](/img/blog/15/15.png)

In this post, I will show you how to enable the New Stickers Feature in Windows 11 Version 22H2.

The New Desktop Background Stickers Feature was previewed in Windows 11 a while ago, but we haven’t had the chance to test it out yet.

The feature is present in Build 22621 as a hidden feature that can be enabled using the **Registry Editor**.

To Enable Stickers, you need to just press <kbd><FontAwesomeIcon icon={faWindows} /></kbd> + R, type `regedit`, press enter, and select `Yes` in the User Account Control Prompt.

In the Registry Editor navigate to the following location:

```
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\PolicyManager\current\device
```

**Right-click on the device key** and go to **New** and **Key**. Name the new Key `Stickers`.

Enter the Stickers key and in the right side right-click and go to **New** and select `DWORD (32-bit) Value`.

Name the Value **Enable Stickers** and set its value to **1** and then click on **OK**.

And that's it, you now have the Desktop Background Stickers Feature Enabled in Windows 11 22H2.

You can access the feature by **right-clicking on the Desktop, Personalize,** and then **Background**.

From **Choose stickers for your wallpaper**, click on **Add stickers**.

The following screen will appear with a nice menu from where you can choose from a various selection of Stickers. While on this screen the taskbar will be hidden. **Double-click on a Sticker** to add to the desktop.

When you double-click again on a Sticker from the desktop, you will be able to **resize it** and also **delete it** if you want. You can also **move the Stickers** freely on the screen.

![15-5](/img/blog/15/15-5.png)

The selected Stickers will be always **present on the screen**, and **behind every window** that you use.
